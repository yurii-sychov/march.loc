## File structure

For simplification navigation in a project use module file structure, in ```src/assets/scss```, ```src/assets/js```
or ```src/views```
use the same folder and file naming. Main pattern is:

- ```ui``` - some king of buttons, input field, links, modal dialogs, topography or any another element which we are
  shared fo all of website
- ```components``` - some king of select, form, accordion, filter or any another part of code includes ```ui``` elements
  and also can be shared for all of website
- ```modules``` - some independent entity, like a page section which includes ```ui``` and ```components``` also can be
  shared for all of pages
